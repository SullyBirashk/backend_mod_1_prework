## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
-One point that resonated with me was the fact when you accept that you will fail and struggle, you will adopt a growth mindset and improve every single day. (Understand mistakes are essential to learning)
-Another point that resonated with me was never compare your skills with others, always track your own progress, and it's less daunting when you stop comparing yourself, and grow at your own pace.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate a growth mindset by lowering my ego in times of learning something new, and be excited to go through the process of learning it!
Some days I wake up and have a fixed mindset. I try and sit down and learn something new, but for some reason I can't focus. I need to find a motivation or plan for times like these.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
A Hash is an array where the elements have value, so when you call on a specific element, it has a key and a value, which you can call by typing array.keys or array.values .

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
pet_store = {dog_food: 100, cat_food: 70, fish_tank: 25, dog_toys: 55}

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states.value[1]

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.keys

states.values

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
A good example is ordering from a chipotle app, if if you want extra meat in your burrito, it would look like this

order_223414 = {rice: 1, beans: 0, meat: 2, cheese: 1, etc }


1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

What are the most efficient ways to add an element to an array, because there are many ways, but which is the most professional
