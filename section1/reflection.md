## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
One thing that helped me a lot was view learning as a process and not a final destination. It helps me be patient and actually obtain the knowledge rather than rush it to get it done. One thing I need to work on is taking care of my brain, I need to fix my sleep schedule and start eating healthier. I would add be patient with the process to show you that everything takes time.

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
puts "Hello World!" or print "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
It is going to be the Hash key (#) It indicates you are commenting on the code rather than running it.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is any number and a float is any number with a decimal.

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
puts animal or print animal

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
An interpolation is a variable in a string.  exe "#{variable}"
puts "I went to the zoo, and my favorite animal is #{animal}!"

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
The method would be gets.chomp

1. Name and describe two common string methods:
One method is assigning a variable to a string and then print or puts variable
example:
today = "Here is the first half of the string, "
tomorrow = "here is the second half of the string"
puts today
puts tomorrow

Another example is using interpolation
Another example is
name = Sully
height = 5'10
age = 20
puts "Welcome #{name}, so you're #{age} years old and #{height} tall?"
